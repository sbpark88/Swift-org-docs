// 1. Mutability of Collections (콜렉션의 변경)

/*
Swift provides three primary collection types for storing collections of values.
- Array
- Set
- Dictionary

These are always clear about the types of values and keys that they can store,
so you cannot insert a value of the wrong type into a collection by mistake.

If you create an array, a set, or a dictionary, and assign it to a variable(var), the collections that's will be mutable.
However, if you assign it to a constant(let), the collections is immutable, and its size and contents cannot be changed.
